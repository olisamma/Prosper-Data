## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that people who are employed and have larger salaries generally had higher prosper score, lower interest rate and completion of loan payment.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the presentation, I focused on LoanStatus, EmploymentStatus, Term, BorrowerRate, ProsperScore and IncomeVerifiable amongst others. I looked at each of these varibles individually and together, creating plots with clear clolor schemes in the process to make exploration clear enough even before reading the remarks at the end of each chart and the conclusion at the end.
